# Changelog

All notable changes to RustaSea are recorded in this file.

This project follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and intends to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
RustaSea is pre-1.0: while the major version is `0`, the public API may still
change between minor releases, and any breaking change is called out in the
entry that introduces it. The versioning and tagging intent is defined in
`.agents/documents/tasks/roadmap.md` (section 5, "Release & Tagging Strategy").

## How to read this file

- **Format:** entries are grouped by delivery program and stamped with the date
  the work landed, newest first. Each entry lists the affected milestone
  (`M0`-`M6`), the task identifiers (`GAP-*`, `ADOPT-*`, `LARAVEL-*`,
  `AUTH-*`, `CFG-*`, `DB-*`, `RTE-*`, `SK-*`, `STG-*`, `TST-*`), and the
  commit subject lines where useful.
- **Traceability:** per `docs/documentation-conventions.md` (standard
  `STD-001`), this file cites milestone IDs, task IDs, and commit subject
  lines. It does not embed raw commit SHAs.
- **Status source:** the authoritative, evidence-backed per-milestone status is
  `docs/milestones.md`. Where a milestone is delivered only in part, that is
  stated here explicitly rather than implied.
- **Releases:** no git tags exist in this repository yet. Nothing below is a
  published release; the entries describe work merged to `master`. The planned
  release mapping is recorded in the "Versioning plan" section.

## Versioning plan

Per `.agents/documents/tasks/roadmap.md` (section 5), each milestone is intended
to ship as a tagged release on `master` with migration notes tracked in this
file. No tag has been created yet, so the mapping below is a plan, not a record
of released versions.

| Planned tag | Milestone | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| `v0.1.0` | M0 | Bootstrap & Core |
| `v0.2.0` | M1 | Routing & HTTP |
| `v0.3.0` | M2 | ORM & Database |
| `v0.4.0` | M3 | Auth, Middleware & Validation |
| `v0.5.0` | M4 | Queue, Cache, Scheduling & Events |
| `v0.6.0` | M5 | DX, CLI & Testing |
| `v0.7.0` | M6 | Advanced (Broadcast, Search, Filesystem, AI SDK) |

`1.0.0` is a candidate after the framework is dog-fooded (roadmap section 5).
Per the same section, each tag is expected to pass `cargo xtask ci` and
`cargo xtask check-cycles` before it is cut.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- 2026-09-24 - `storage-s3` umbrella feature forwarding to
  `rustasea-storage/aws` (the `aws` feature needs rustc 1.89+ through
  `object_store`'s `crc-fast` dependency), and a Docker-backed RustFS suite
  (`crates/rustasea-storage/tests/rustfs_container.rs`, run with
  `--features aws -- --ignored`) that round-trips an `s3` disk over a
  plain-HTTP endpoint. `cargo xtask ci` and the CI test job now also cover
  `rustasea-storage` with its opt-in `aws` and `sftp` drivers (M6;
  `feat(rustasea): add storage-s3 umbrella feature`; `ci: lint and test
  rustasea-storage with the aws and sftp features`).
- 2026-09-17 - Svelte starter-kit variant with full auth/settings page parity: the
  `svelte` variant scaffolds the same 11 auth/settings pages as the react/vue
  kits on the shared Inertia contract
  (`feat(scaffold): [TASK-107] complete auth and settings page parity for Inertia
  variants`; `feat(scaffold): [TASK-106] add svelte starter-kit variant backed by
  Sycamore`).
- 2026-09-17 - Sycamore WASM adapter for the svelte variant: `rustasea-inertia-adapters`
  gains a `svelte` feature (Sycamore router context, provider, and Inertia link)
  and the umbrella exposes `wasm-sycamore`, so the `svelte` kit maps to
  Rust-native fine-grained reactive WASM with no Node.js toolchain
  (`feat(inertia): [TASK-105] add Sycamore WASM adapter for the svelte variant`).
- 2026-09-17 - Four first-party starter-kit repositories published, mirroring the
  `laravel/<x>-starter-kit` split (ADR-0002): `rustasea/react-starter-kit`
  (Dioxus WASM + Inertia), `rustasea/vue-starter-kit` (Leptos WASM + Inertia),
  `rustasea/svelte-starter-kit` (Sycamore WASM + Inertia), and
  `rustasea/livewire-starter-kit` (askama + HTMX); `rustasea/rustasea` remains the
  Blade skeleton (TASK-108, TASK-109, TASK-110, TASK-111).
- 2026-09-17 - Example application domain in the runnable `rustasea-app` crate:
  a scaffold-style `app/` tree with a `Post` model plus in-memory
  `PostRepository`, a JSON CRUD `PostController` implementing the base
  `Controller` trait, `StorePostRequest`/`UpdatePostRequest` validatable form
  requests, and a `CreatePostAction` demonstrating the `Action` pattern; served
  as a demo JSON API at `/examples/posts` and wired into the route table
  (`feat(app): [TASK-097] add example app domain module (models, controllers,
  requests, actions) to rustasea-app`).
- 2026-09-17 - Generated-app boot parity: the scaffold's `bootstrap/commands.rs`
  registers the framework command surface (and queue migrations) via
  `rustasea::cli::load_default_commands()` plus the application's nine own
  migrations through `rustasea::orm::register_migration`, so `cargo artisan
  migrate` runs the real schema instead of reporting an empty registry
  (`feat(scaffold): [TASK-096] wire generated-app boot parity and emit
  rustfmt.toml + CI workflow`).
- 2026-09-17 - Generated apps ship a `rustfmt.toml` mirroring the framework's
  formatting contract and a minimal `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running
  `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings`, and
  `cargo test` on stable (`feat(scaffold): [TASK-096] wire generated-app boot
  parity and emit rustfmt.toml + CI workflow`).
- 2026-09-17 - App scaffold emits Hypervel-parity broadcasting and CORS config
  templates (`config/broadcasting.toml`, `config/cors.toml`) with their
  `.env.example` mirror (`feat(scaffold): [TASK-095] emit broadcasting and CORS
  config templates (Hypervel parity)`).
- 2026-09-17 - App scaffold emits Hypervel-parity root hygiene and directory
  placeholders: `.gitattributes`, `LICENSE`, a `public/` web root
  (`robots.txt`, `favicon.ico`), `bootstrap/cache/`, and the `storage/`
  subdirectory `.gitignore` set (`feat(scaffold): [TASK-094] emit
  Hypervel-parity root hygiene and directory placeholders`).
- 2026-09-17 - Base `Controller` trait with shared JSON/validation/redirect
  helpers and the `redirect`/`see_other` free functions (Hypervel parity)
  (`feat(http): [TASK-091] add base Controller trait and redirect helpers
  (Hypervel parity)`).
- 2026-09-17 - App scaffold emits the `app/http/controllers/controller.rs` base
  controller and struct controllers implementing it (Hypervel parity)
  (`feat(scaffold): [TASK-092] emit app base controller and struct controllers
  (Hypervel parity)`).
- 2026-09-17 - `make:controller` now generates base-controller-conforming
  structs (`impl Controller for <Name> {}`) for both plain and `--resource`
  output (Hypervel parity) (`feat(cli): [TASK-093] generate
  base-controller-conforming make:controller output (Hypervel parity)`).
- 2026-09-17 - Interactive auth and settings forms for the Inertia React/Vue and
  Blade starter kits (`feat(ui): [UI-AUTH-001] interactive auth and settings
  forms for Inertia React/Vue and Blade`).
- 2026-09-17 - Gap analysis and traceability matrix with task specifications for
  `GAP-022` through `GAP-031` (`docs(audit): add gap analysis matrix and GAP-022
  through GAP-031 task specifications`).

### Changed

- 2026-09-24 - `s3` disks now work with S3-compatible services such as RustFS
  and MinIO: an explicit `http://` endpoint enables `object_store`'s
  `allow_http` (previously every request failed with a reqwest builder error,
  including the documented `endpoint = "http://localhost:9000"` example).
  The `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`,
  `AWS_BUCKET`, and `AWS_ENDPOINT` variables documented in `.env.example`,
  previously never read, now override the matching keys of every `s3` disk
  in `config/storage.toml`; note that the stock `.env.example` sets
  `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1`. `bucket` may be omitted when `AWS_BUCKET`
  is set, and a blank bucket is rejected with `StorageError::Config`.
  `S3DiskConfig` moved to `rustasea_storage::s3` (still re-exported from the
  crate root and `facade`) and redacts `secret_access_key` from `Debug`
  output (M6; `refactor(storage): move S3DiskConfig into its own module and
  share env helpers`; `fix(storage): support S3-compatible http endpoints
  and AWS_* env for s3 disks`).
- 2026-09-17 - `cargo install rustasea` now installs the application scaffolder:
  the `cargo-rustasea` binary moved into the `rustasea` facade package (ships
  behind the `scaffold` feature, enabled by default) so `cargo rustasea new`
  works from a single install, and the standalone `cargo-rustasea` package was
  removed. The workspace is now 42 crates under `crates/` + `xtask`
  (43 workspace packages) (`refactor(scaffold): [TASK-103] fold cargo-rustasea
  bin into the rustasea facade package`).
- 2026-09-17 - App scaffold now emits Laravel-parity port 8000: the generated
  `.env.example`, README, `Dockerfile` (`EXPOSE`/healthcheck), and
  `docker-compose.yml` all use 8000 (matching `php artisan serve` and
  `config/app.toml`), and the generated `main.rs` derives its bind address from
  `APP_URL` (host:port) with an `0.0.0.0:8000` fallback instead of hard-coding
  the port, fixing the README claim that `APP_URL` overrides the bind
  (`fix(scaffold): [TASK-101] emit Laravel-parity port 8000 and derive the bind
  from APP_URL`).
- 2026-09-17 - Repository renamed to `rustasea/framework` (analog
  `laravel/framework`); the application skeleton lives at `rustasea/rustasea`
  (analog `laravel/laravel`). In-repo URLs, `Cargo.toml` `repository` metadata
  (workspace-inherited across all 43 packages), and the README repository layout
  section were updated (`chore(repo): [TASK-098] rename to rustasea/framework
  and add repository metadata`).
- 2026-09-17 - Documentation reconciliation: canonical crate inventory
  synchronized to the 43 workspace packages (`GAP-022`); stale `route:list` and
  attribute-consumption documentation corrected (`GAP-023`); complete artisan
  CLI command surface documented (`GAP-024`); `make:*` generator count
  reconciled to 17 (`GAP-025`); Laravel parity and milestone status aligned with
  all 31 ADOPT implementations (`GAP-026`); ADOPT crates and umbrella features
  documented in the README (`GAP-027`).
- 2026-09-17 - Source-level `show:model {name} [--json]` introspection of a
  model's attributes, casts, soft-delete/timestamp flags, and relations
  (`GAP-029`, `feat(cli): [GAP-029] implement source-level show:model
  introspection with JSON output`).
- 2026-09-17 - Per-chunk HTTP idle-timeout enforcement on streamed response
  bodies (`GAP-030`, `feat(http): [GAP-030] enforce per-chunk idle timeout on
  streamed response bodies`).
- 2026-09-17 - `cargo xtask lines:check` 500-line linter wired into `cargo
  xtask ci` (`GAP-031`, `feat(xtask): [GAP-031] add lines:check 500-line linter
  and enforce in xtask ci`).

### Added (governance)

- 2026-09-17 - Repository root governance documents: `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `SECURITY.md` (`GAP-028`).

  original name for traceability; current branding is RustaSea.

### 2026-01-31 - Project inception

- 2026-01-31 - Initial README for the project (`Add initial README.md for
  rustavel project`), followed by the Laravel 13 research and the M0-M6
  milestone README (`TASK-002`/`TASK-003`).

## Notes

- The per-milestone statuses above reflect `docs/milestones.md` as of its last
  update; consult that document for the current evidence (`path:line`) and
  remaining work.
- The ADOPT wave, the authentication program, and the gap-closure program all
  landed after the initial milestone implementation; their entries are grouped
  separately above so the milestone history stays readable.
